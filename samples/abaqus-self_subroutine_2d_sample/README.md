# Sample for a pseudo coupling

---

## Goal

The goal of this simulation is to show that this framework can be used to change e.g. boundary conditions at each node of a mesh in a Simulia Abaqus simulation. 
This corresponds to the application of a pseudo coupling, means that only one engine is used and the modification of a boundary condition (here pore pressure) is made by a simple function or (like here) with a random lowering of the existing boundary conditions. 
This can also be used while developing an new engine.
